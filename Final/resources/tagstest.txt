* Okay, I'll help you with formating. Let it be a line break. wait = 5 x = 50 y = 50
linebreak wait = 5 x = 50 y = 50

timewait='5 sec'

pos: 0
t
wait!firstpart = 9 wait!secondpart = 11
* Hope it's working well! I really hope  wait = 300 x = 50 y = 50
timewait='5 sec' wait = 5 x = 50 y = 50
so! wait = 5 x = 50 y = 50
linebreak wait = 5 x = 50 y = 50
* It's time for some  wait = 5 x = 50 y = 50
